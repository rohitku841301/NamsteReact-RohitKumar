The crossorigin attribute is used in HTML to specify how browsers should handle loading of external resources, such as images, scripts, stylesheets, and fonts, when they are requested from a different origin (domain) than the one serving the HTML page. It's closely related to the concept of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which I explained in a previous response.
